# React JS Based Starlink Trajectory Visualization

Built location, altitude, and duration-based selectors to refine the satellite search.



## Description

* Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites based on geo-location in real time.
* Animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve user-friendliness.



## Getting Started

### Clone/Pull the Repo

```
git clone -b master https://github.com/shuyushang/star-link-frontend.git
```


### Install npm

Navigate to the cloned repo, bring up your terminal or cmd window, and type in,

```
npm install
```
You only need to do this once.


### Run the Starlink Trajectory Visualization

Once npm is installed, type in,

```
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the StarLink Trajectory if the browser does not launch automatically!


### Hands-on

Provide the "Duration(min)" and "Find Satellite" and select the Satellites-of-Interest to "Track on the map"!
